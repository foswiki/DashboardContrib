%TOC%

This Extension adds a Widget based dashboard to your user's home pages.

Users can Add, remove, move premade, or self developed Widget topic results like Task List, Site Changes, Calendars etc.

I've always wanted a user topic that was useful to me day to day, and this might be it.

---+++ roadmap
---++++ v0.1 - start
done - ugly, hardcoded ViewTemplate that includes a number of Widgets topics
---++++ v0.2 - prettify and add more widgets
done - using html, css and js from jquery.org
---++++ v0.3 - add UI and backend to save user changes
---++++ v0.4 - add parameters and options the user can set for each widget.
---++++ more todos 
   * Widgets form with an edit template to help people create new ones
   * view widgets form template should show the widget.. and docco (and an add button)
   * add section to the topic for title, colour?, so that cna be customised

---+++ details.
Widgets are defined in the Main web __TODO__ as topics ending in =Widget=.

The ViewTemplate iterates over the list of widgets and adds them to the topic.


__TODO__ howto mark certain widgets need certain plugins? (just use IF{}?)
